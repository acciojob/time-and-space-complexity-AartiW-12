	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how efficiently an algorithm runs as input size grows.</p>
	<p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses, and an example is O(n) for storing data proportional to the input size.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses, and an example is O(n) for storing data proportional to the input size.</p>
